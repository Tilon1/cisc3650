1:The demographic of users are those that are 10 and up. The reason why is because when you reach the age where you can functionally work a piece of technology you can use this to-do list to complete your tasks
2:I wanted to create a sleek and simple to do list where the user knew what to do and adding items to the list were seamlessa and easy.
3: Considering Schneidermanâ€™s eight heuristics for interface design, I offered informative feedback because when you click on the x the list you want delted becomes deleted and if you click a check box the check appears and goes away. I've also provided easy reversal of actions because if you deicde that you accidentaly clicked on a check box you can undo it by clicking on the check box again
4: I would say that the simplicity and sleeknes of my ewebsite is appealing. I could definetly improve on the boxes so when a user adds an item another checkbox doesnt appear.
5: one affordance would be the x button which cleary deletes the list item whic is definitely a true affordance. One constrain will be that you cannot change an item once its added which is a logical constraint;
